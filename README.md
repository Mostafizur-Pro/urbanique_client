A full stack E-Commerce application built using the MERN stack. Users can navigate through the various links on the dynamic React front-end. Users can view, filter and sort the available products on the shop page and add items to cart. 
Users will need to register and log in to the app to be able to access and modify the cart. The user information is stored securely in a MongoDB Atlas database. Users can only access and modify the cart once logged in, which is tracked using JWT authentication. 
All this supported by the Node.js and Express.js backend which connects the front-end to the database and products API.
